# Nuclear Fusion Energy: Progress and Prospects

## Introduction to Fusion Energy

Nuclear fusion—the process that powers stars—represents one of humanity's most promising pathways to abundant, clean energy. Unlike nuclear fission, which splits heavy atoms, fusion combines light atomic nuclei (typically isotopes of hydrogen) to form heavier elements, releasing enormous energy in the process. Fusion offers significant advantages over existing energy sources: virtually limitless fuel supply, zero greenhouse gas emissions, no risk of meltdown, and minimal long-lived radioactive waste.

## The Science of Fusion

### Fusion Reactions
The most accessible fusion reaction for terrestrial applications combines deuterium (²H) and tritium (³H), isotopes of hydrogen:

²H + ³H → ⁴He (3.5 MeV) + n (14.1 MeV)

This reaction produces helium and a high-energy neutron, releasing 17.6 MeV of energy per reaction—approximately four million times more energy per kilogram than coal combustion.

### Triple Product: The Key Parameter
Successful fusion requires satisfying the Lawson criterion, typically expressed as the triple product:
n × T × τₑ > 5 × 10²¹ m⁻³ × keV × s

Where:
* n = plasma density (particles per cubic meter)
* T = plasma temperature (typically 100-200 million degrees Celsius)
* τₑ = energy confinement time (how long energy remains in the plasma)

## Major Approaches to Fusion
